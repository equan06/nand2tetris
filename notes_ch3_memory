basic 1 bit register -> 32 bit register -> multiple registers = RAM

RAM has 3 inputs:
	- load bit (read/write)
	- address (which register to access)
	- data
	
RAM width = width of each register (32/64 bit)
RAM size = number of registers (hundreds of millions)


In sequential chips (Data Flip Flops, registers, memory banks, counter chips), outputs only change after clock cycles 

If feeding data to a combinational chip (time invariant), it will change its state as soon as all the inputs arrive. Its output is sequential (some register/RAM). To make sure that the output is ready before the next clock cycle, simply make the clock cycle > max distance between all chip paths

At start of clock cycle, DFFs receive their outputs from the prev cycle. 
After, their outputs are fixed until the next cycle, regardless of input changes
